"""
Art Mockup Generator (Enhanced Quality & Color Matching) developed by Etem Uyar(@ieuyar)

This script takes photos from an input folder, crops them to a 24x36 aspect ratio, 
adds a fine art frame and mat, and then uses the Gemini API to generate high-quality,
realistic mockups. It will skip generating mockups that already exist in the output folder.

Setup:
1. Install required libraries:
   pip install pillow requests colorthief

2. Create folders:
   - Create a folder named `your_photos` in the same directory as this script.
   - Place all the photos you want to create mockups for inside `your_photos`.
   - The script will automatically create a `mockup_outputs` folder for the results.

3. Get a Gemini API Key:
   - Visit https://makersuite.google.com/ to get your free API key.
   - Paste your key into the API_KEY variable below.
